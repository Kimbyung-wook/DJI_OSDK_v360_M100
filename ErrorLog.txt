ERRORLOG/1 @ activate, L1271: Solutions for NEW_DEVICE_ERROR:
	* Double-check your app_id and app_key in UserConfig.txt. Does it match with your DJI developer account?
	* If this is a new device, please make sure your DJI Go App is connected to internet to activate the new device for the first time.
	* If this device is previously activated with another app_id and app_key, you will need to re-activate it again (with internet through DJI GO App).
	* A new device needs to be activated twice to fix the NEW_DEVICE_ERROR, so please try it twice.
